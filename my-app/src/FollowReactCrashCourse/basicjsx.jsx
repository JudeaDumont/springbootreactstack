/*
* html element properties are limited to what can be placed on that element type.
* we can't pass in a 'whateveriwant' tag into the html element because that property is notdefined for that element in the html spec
* with react, because it is a custom component, we can pass in any property or attribute that we want.
* we have four pieces of data that we need to pass in. right now we are just going to pass in some data, we are not going to consume it until next lesson..
